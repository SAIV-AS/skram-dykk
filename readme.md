# SkramDykk 

SkramDykk is an open source tool to read data from a CTD, store, analyse and visusalise the data.
The goal of the project is that we can produce better 2D and 3D visualizations of 
data from dives so that students and teachers better can understand the dynamics and biology of oceans. 

The tool will run on a Linux server and consists of several tools to fetch and manage data. 

The work is supported by:

* Amalie Skram VGS - www.avgs.no
* Universitetet i Bergen - Geofysisk - www.uib.no
* Sensario.no - www.sensar.io

At present the server is located at  [http://146.185.167.10](http://146.185.167.10)
