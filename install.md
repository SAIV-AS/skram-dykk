# Installing 

The programs needed to run the software are:

* Python3
* PIP 
* MongoDB

For Python it is required to install several libraries.
To install the Python libraries run the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before you start running the code make sure you modify some paths:

* The path to CD to in the update.sh script
* The LOCALDIR in the fetchdata/fetchdata.py script

We recommend to install the webserver with NGINX and UWGSI
